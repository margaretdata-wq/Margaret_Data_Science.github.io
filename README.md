### ADHD Medication Use, June 2025 – Dec 2025 

Research Intern - Boston University Medical School

●      This project analyzed ADHD medication data in the US before and after COVID-19. We developed a machine-learning model to forecast consumption absent the pandemic. Comparison with observed data showed the pandemic caused only temporary disruption.

### IoMT Cybersecurity, June 2025- Aug 2025

Research Intern - University System of New Hampshire, Medical Cybersecurity Lab

●      This project aimed to detect reconnaissance attacks on Internet Medical Things (IoMT) networks. We built a logistic regression model to identify abnormal network behavior and developed a mobile app to visualize real-time traffic data.

### History of Women in Finance, Oct 2024 – Dec 2024 

Selected Independent Study Student - Weston High School Independent Research Committee

●      This project examined women’s underrepresentation in finance and related historical factors. I created a StoryMap webpage using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS) to map women pioneers and historical turning points.

### SAT Score Disparities, July 2023 – Sep 2023

Research Student Volunteer – Wharton Data Science Academy & University System of New Hampshire

●      This project investigated correlations between SAT performance and socioeconomic factors. Using school-level SAT data on Kaggle.com and statistical methods, we found socioeconomic disadvantage to be the strongest predictor of lower scores.
